Surviving the Night Game

Stage 1:
- Sun is setting, you can 'light' a fire and eat supper, go 'outside' to gather resources or you can 'stay' put inside.
	- Light
		--> Progress to next stage 
	- Outside
		--> Death for not eating
	- Stay
		--> Death of boredom
	- ELSE
		--> Stand around, do nothing, go crazy and die
Stage 2:
- You are full and ready to prep for the cold, harsh winter night. You can go 'outside' to gather resources, 'search' the house or 'tend' the fire?
	- Outside
		--> Freeze to death because you aren't prepared
	- Search
		--> Gather a torch, axe and progress to next stage
	- Tend
		--> You stand above the fire, and...
			--> Secret cheat: "zedshawstinks"
			--> Anything else return to stage 2
	- ELSE
		--> Stand around, do nothing, go crazy and die
Stage 3:
- You have your resources, the fire fades out, and you have two choices: 'light' the torch or go 'outside' again. You can even 'stay' inside.
	- Light
		--> Light the torch and progress to next stage
	- Outside
		--> You didn't light the torch thus you go outside into darkness, and freeze to death. It's simple.
	- Stay
		--> You get bored and die.
	- ELSE
		--> Stand around, do nothing, go crazy and die
Stage 4:
- Torch is lit, axe is ready. You can finally go 'outside' or, again, 'stay' inside if you really want.
	- Outside
		--> You head outside and mark some trees good for cutting
		--> Progress to next stage
	- Stay
		--> What are you doing? You just spontaneously combust.
	- ELSE
		--> Stand around, do nothing, go crazy and die
Stage 5:
- You marked some trees but you hear a twig snap in the distance, you can now 'approach' the trees or head back 'inside'.
	- Approach
		--> You approach the tree and begin cutting
		--> Suddenly a beast emerges from the woods and mauls you to death.
	- Inside
		--> You go inside because you forgot something...
		--> You grab your shotgun, check its load and go back outside
		--> Progress to stage 6
	- ELSE
		--> You do nothing of note whilst in the freezing cold, dead of the night so you die. I don't know how but you die.
Stage 6:
- You are now armed and ready. Do you 'approach' the trees, or 'search' the woods?
	- Approach
		--> You approach the trees, and start cutting the wood
		--> After a while of cutting, you go to rest but to turn to see the beast
		--> The beast mauls you to death before you can grab your shotgun
	- Search
		--> You sneak around the knee-deep snow, weaving in and out of trees
		--> You manage to sneak upon the beast with its back turned
		--> Progress to stage 7
	- ELSE
		--> OK, well, you die because you've done nothing of note.
Stage 7:
- You have the beast with its back to you. Do you 'aim' your shot, or do you 'hip' fire it with a quick double tap Terminator-style?
	- Aim
		--> You try to align the gun for a headshot.
		--> The cold gives you a shakey grip, and you misfire
		--> You startle the beast which charges you, takes you down and beats you, like a drum, to death.
	- Hip
		--> You hip fire like Charles Bronson as you tread through the snow
		--> Both shots hit successfully and the beast yelps in pain
		--> You reload, and do another double hip fire like a badass
		--> The beast slumps in the snow.  You check for any signs of life
		--> It's dead.
		--> Progress to next stage
	- ELSE
		--> You stand there doing nothing and the beast notices you. You can guess what happens next.
		--> You die.
Stage 8:
- After recuperating, you can either 'walk' back to the trees to finish cutting or 'search' the beast?
	- Walk
		--> You walk back, cut the wood needed and head back inside
		--> Progress to next stage
	- Search
		--> This isn't that developed of a game, so this is just weird.
		--> You die because I said so and you're searching a beast, which doesn't have pockets.
	- ELSE
		--> Death
Stage 9:
- You cut the trees in peace, and gather enough log to last the night
- You have a choice: 'stay' outside or 'go' inside. I suggest you pick 'go'.
	- Stay
		--> This wasn't a trick question. A group of beast find their friend dead and get you.
	- Go
		--> You head inside
		--> Progress to next stage
	- ELSE
		--> Death
Stage 10:
- You head inside, add wood to the fire and go to sleep
- You have survived the night. Well done!
